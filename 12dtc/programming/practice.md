# Explanation from the standard

| Achievement | Achievement with Merit | Achievement with Excellence |
| :-- | :-: | --: |
| Use advanced programming techniques to develop a computer program | Use advanced programming techniques to develop an informed computer program | Use advanced programming techniques to develop a refined computer program |

An advanced computer program:
- uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
- uses sequence, selection and iteration control structures
- takes input from a user, sensors, or other external source
- produces output
- uses two or more advanced programming techniques.

Examples of **advanced programming techniques** include:
- modifying data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dicionaries)
- storing multidimensional data in collections
- creating methods, functions, or procedures that use parameters an- or return values
- responding to events generated by a graphical user interface (GUI)
- using non-trivial string manipulation
- using additional non-core libraries.

# Time allowance

You will have two weeks to complete this task.

There will be **NO** extensions.

# Task

You have found recent employment at a movie streaming service and have the task to create a program that will keep track of all the movies on the site. You decide that you will implement a system in Python that will allow you to keep track of all the movies, along with how long each one lasts. You realise that this should be automatic, but for this early prototype, you are happy to enter data by hand. 

Your program will let you:

- record the name and running time of a movie in seconds
- delete a movie from your records
- edit the length of a stored movie
- display the running time of a given movie in hours, minutes an- seconds in the format ``HH:MM:SS``
- list all the movie names (in alphabetical order) along with their running times in hours, minutes and seconds

## Example menu

```
Please enter:
(A)	to Add a movie
(D)	to Delete a movie
(E)	to Edit the length of a movie
(L)	to get the Length of a movie
(P)	to print out all the movies and their times
(Q)	to Quit
```

# Restrictions

You must:
- use a suitable, text-based programming language
  - You will be expected to use Python unless you have consulted with your teacher

You may:
- consult this website's notes
- consult your previous work
- consult with other students for advice and ideas

However, you may **not**:
- copy other students' work, even with modifications
- copy code online without proper attribution
- ask other students to fix errors for you
- present any content as your own work

# Submission

- Your work will be submitted through GitHub Classrooms
- Only the final commit before the due date will be considered â€” any commits after the due date will not be assessed
