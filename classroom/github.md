# Commiting code to Github

When you make changes to a file or multiple files, commit the changes back to Github. This way, the files are stored on Github and you won't lose them.

1. Click on the ![Source Control](../img/source-control.svg) Source Control tab
2. You will see a list of files with changes. To send them to Github, you need to **stage the changes** to commit. Click on the ![Add](../img/add.svg) Add button next to those files.
3. In the box that reads Message, click and type a **commit message** that sums up the changes you have made. See this guide [how to write commit messages](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53).
4. After you have staged your changes and entered a commit message, click on the ![Commit](../img/check.svg) Commit button.
5. There are two ways to push the commit(s) to Github:
   1. Click on the Sync Changes button (if it is showing), **or**
   2. Click on the ![Ellipsis](../img/ellipsis.svg) button then click Push.
