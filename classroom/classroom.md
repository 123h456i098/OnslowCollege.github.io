Throughout the year, you will demonstrate your understanding of complex programming techniques such as object-oriented programming by completing GitHub Classroom assignments.

# Create a school GitHub account

To participate in GitHub Classroom, you will need to create a school GitHub account by signing up with your school Microsoft account. You may already have received an invitation from your teacher to your school email account, so please check in [Outlook Online](https://office.com/outlook).

**Note: Do not use a personal GitHub account**. If you forget your login details or your account, you may not have any recourse and risk **failing your assessment**; by creating a school account, we may be able to help in case of a problem. If you wish to transfer your work to a personal account after you have submitted, you can fork it at the end of the year.


# Accept your assignment

You can access your assignments by:

1. visiting [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and finding the relevant assignment in the relevant class, orâ€¦
2. finding the assignment invitation link in the lesson


# Check out the assignment repository in Visual Studio Code

There are two ways to download code from GitHub into Visual Studio Code.
